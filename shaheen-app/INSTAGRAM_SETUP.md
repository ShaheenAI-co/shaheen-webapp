# Instagram Business API Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Instagram Business API integration for the Shaheen AI webapp.

## üéâ **Great News! Your App is Already Approved!**

Your Facebook App (ID: `1274014204192589`) has been approved for Instagram Business API access with the following **essential permissions**:
- `instagram_business_basic` - Access to basic business profile info
- `instagram_business_content_publish` - Publish content to Instagram

**Note**: We're only requesting the permissions you actually need for posting content, keeping the integration focused and secure.

## üîê **Long-Lived Token Support**

The integration automatically exchanges short-lived tokens for **long-lived tokens that last 60 days**, ensuring persistent access without frequent re-authentication.

## üóÑÔ∏è **Supabase Integration**

All Instagram accounts and long-lived tokens are securely stored in your Supabase database with proper user isolation and security policies.

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ **Facebook Developer Account** - Already set up  
‚úÖ **Facebook App** - Already created and configured  
‚úÖ **Instagram Business Account** - Already connected  
‚úÖ **App Approval** - Already approved by Meta  
‚úÖ **Supabase Project** - For secure token storage  
‚úÖ **Clerk Authentication** - For user management  

## Step 1: Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Instagram Business API Configuration
# Your app has been approved for Instagram Business API access
FB_APP_ID=1274014204192589
FB_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret_here

# App URL (for redirect URI) - Use your Vercel deployment URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://shaheen-webapp.vercel.app

# Make sure FB_APP_ID is also available on the client side
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_APP_ID=1274014204192589

# Supabase Configuration (Required for Instagram account storage)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Clerk Configuration (Required for user authentication)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

**Important**: You only need to add your `FB_APP_SECRET` - the app ID is already configured!

## Step 2: Get Your Facebook App Secret

1. Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Select your app (ID: `1274014204192589`)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Basic**
4. Copy the **App Secret** and add it to your `.env.local` file

## Step 3: Set Up Supabase Database

### 3.1 Create the Instagram Accounts Table

Run the following SQL migration in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create Instagram accounts table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS instagram_accounts (
    instagram_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Instagram Business Account ID
    clerk_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL REFERENCES users(clerk_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    username VARCHAR(255),            -- Instagram account username
    access_token TEXT NOT NULL,       -- Long-lived access token
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,  -- Token expiration
    connected_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_posted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    UNIQUE(clerk_id, username)        -- Ensure one account per user per username
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_instagram_accounts_clerk_id ON instagram_accounts(clerk_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_instagram_accounts_expires_at ON instagram_accounts(expires_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_instagram_accounts_username ON instagram_accounts(username);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE instagram_accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policy: users can only access their own Instagram accounts
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own Instagram accounts" ON instagram_accounts
    FOR ALL USING (clerk_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub');

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON instagram_accounts TO authenticated;
```

### 3.2 Alternative: Use the Migration File

1. Copy the migration file from `supabase/migrations/001_create_instagram_accounts.sql`
2. Paste it into your Supabase SQL editor
3. Run the migration

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the dashboard page
3. Click "Connect Instagram"
4. Complete the OAuth flow using the approved Instagram Business API
5. Verify that the connection status shows "Connected" with long-lived token info
6. Check your Supabase database to see the stored Instagram accounts

## How It Works

The integration now uses the **Instagram Business API OAuth endpoint** with minimal permissions and automatic long-lived token exchange:

```
https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize?force_reauth=true&client_id=1274014204192589&redirect_uri=https://shaheen-webapp.vercel.app/api/auth/ig-callback&response_type=code&scope=instagram_business_basic%2Cinstagram_business_content_publish
```

### Token Flow:
1. **OAuth Authorization** ‚Üí Get authorization code
2. **Short-lived Token** ‚Üí Exchange code for short-lived token (1-2 hours)
3. **Long-lived Token** ‚Üí Automatically exchange for long-lived token (60 days)
4. **Page Tokens** ‚Üí Get long-lived page access tokens for Instagram business accounts
5. **Database Storage** ‚Üí Save all tokens securely to Supabase with user isolation

### Data Flow:
1. **User Authentication** ‚Üí Clerk handles user login
2. **Instagram OAuth** ‚Üí Get long-lived tokens from Meta
3. **Supabase Storage** ‚Üí Store tokens with user association
4. **Account Management** ‚Üí Users can manage multiple Instagram accounts
5. **Post Scheduling** ‚Üí Schedule posts using stored tokens

## Available Features

With your approved Instagram Business API access, you can:

‚úÖ **Connect Instagram Business Accounts**  
‚úÖ **Schedule Posts** (with the post scheduler component)  
‚úÖ **Publish Content** (create and schedule posts)  
‚úÖ **Basic Profile Access** (account information)  
‚úÖ **Long-lived Tokens** (60-day persistent access)  
‚úÖ **Automatic Token Refresh** (seamless user experience)  
‚úÖ **Multiple Account Support** (manage several Instagram accounts)  
‚úÖ **Secure Token Storage** (Supabase with RLS policies)  
‚úÖ **User Isolation** (each user only sees their own accounts)  

## Why Minimal Permissions?

We're following the **principle of least privilege** by only requesting the permissions you actually need:

- **`instagram_business_basic`** - Required to identify and connect your Instagram business account
- **`instagram_business_content_publish`** - Required to create and schedule posts

This approach:
- üîí **Increases security** - Less access means less risk
- ‚úÖ **Faster approval** - Meta prefers apps with minimal permissions
- üöÄ **Better user trust** - Users see exactly what permissions you need
- üì± **Focused functionality** - Perfect for content scheduling and posting
- üîê **Long-lived access** - 60-day tokens for persistent functionality
- üóÑÔ∏è **Secure storage** - Tokens stored in Supabase with proper security
